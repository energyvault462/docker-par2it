# docker-par2it

This is my personal docker container for creating par files for 
archiving data. This creates a docker image for creating par files of a 
folder and sub folders. 

To build: 
./buildIt

To run:
./parit /path/to/folder/to/par

It will create a log at ~/ and will rename it when finished.
